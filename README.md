# Ilias-to-Booklet-Converter

This script is intended to be used on files exported from the LMS (Learning Management System) ILIAS.
It converts exercises exported from ILIAS that contain many individual
assignments handed in by different students into one booklet per student
containing the first page of every exercise.

The main didactic context this is useful for are what are often called
booklet exams: Students are allowed to hand in one page of (often
hand-written) notes every week or so, and are provided with a printout of
their notes in brochure form when they take their exam.

More information and an English translation of the script will follow
later.
